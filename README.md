**A Low-Complexity Algorithm for Intrusion Detection in a PIR-Based Wireless Sensor Network**<br>
• Investigated the problem of detecting a human intruder in the presence of  clutter arising from wind-blown vegetation in a passive infra-red (PIR) based wireless sensor network (WSN).<br>
• Proposed a low-complexity algorithm based on a combination of Haar Transform (HT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based training. Extensive field testing of the algorithm was done. The algorithm exhibited a very good performance.

**Analytical Model For Intruder Signature**<br>
• Goal was to come up with a model for the intruder signature.<br>
• Provided a closed-form expression for a good approximation to the intruder waveform.<br>
•	Developed, for the first time in literature, a model for the PIR sensor’s signature.<br>
• Used this to determine how to optimally place multiple sensing nodes so as to estimate the path of the intruder in motion.
